    <h1>Welcome to MindScape: Embrace Your Colors</h1>
    <p>Explore a world where emotions come alive through colors. MindScape is an AI-driven game that focuses on mental health awareness and support. Different emotions are personified as characters, each represented by a unique color, such as depression (blue), anxiety (red), stress (yellow), and more. Players utilize their avatars to help these emotional characters by completing daily tasks, gain experience points, and foster empathy and understanding towards mental health challenges.</p>
